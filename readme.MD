# Kris's Bash Functions

## Description

Sometimes I'll write a little function to make life easier on my MacBook. When I write a function, I put it in my .bash_functions file. Some of them are useful, some of them are stupid, some are productive, some pointless.

Many of them I don't use any more, but have kept just as a reference for various bash scripting techniques, in case I ever want to do something similar in the future.

I try to keep them organized into their various categories.

Feel free to take a look through and use anything that's useful to you, or use them as a reference to write you own.

Regardless, I hope that they're useful to someone in some way.
